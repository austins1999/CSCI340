~ Unlike Java, in C any variable can be passed by reference or value
	~ Reference sends the actual data, and therefore any changes effect
	  other functions as well
	~ Value sends a copy of the data, and therefore any changes will
	  be made moot after the function call is complete
	~ NOTE: For a large data structure, it is always better to pass by
	  reference to conserve memory

~ sizeof()  is a macro, not a function

~ In C, pointing to address 0 actually points to NULL
	~ Null pointer; works the same as in Java
