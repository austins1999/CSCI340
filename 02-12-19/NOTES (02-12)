~ Processes can send Signals
	~ Signals are 16bit numbers (shorts)
	~ Convey messages about process execution to the kernel, containing
		1) Signal name
		2) Numeric value
		3) Action (terminate, ignore, continue, stop, etc.)
		4) Comment (describes meaning/purpose of signal)
	~ Some can be ignored, others can't
		~ eg) If SIGKILL is called, the process is always killed

~ Signal handlers
	~ You can write your own handlers for certain signals, overriding
	  the default handlers
		~ Can't override unignorable signals like SIGKILL
