~ File Descriptor Table
	~ An array that contains entries
	~ The index of a file descriptor is its reference
	~ First three entries are always set
		~ 0) stdin
			~ input (ie keyboard)
		~ 1) stout
			~ output (ie printf)
		~ 2) sterr
			~ error output
	~ eg) If you read() info to file descriptor 1, it will be output to terminal
		~ Because position 1 is always stout
	~ When you create a new item, such as a socket, it is automatically added to
	  the next available line in the file descriptor table
		~ When it is removed, such as the socket being closed, the entry is 
		  removed from the table
	~ printf() always outputs to position 1
		~ It is possible to overwrite these 0-2 "predefined" values
		~ If you overwrite entry 1, then printf() will write directly to a
		  socket/file/etc. instead of the terminal
	~ A file descriptor table is shared between a parent and all its children
